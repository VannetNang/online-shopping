4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the necessary environment variables. See the example below.

5.  **Start the development server:**
    This command will start the Vite development server.

## Environment Variables (.env.example)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You must include the base URL for the backend API your admin panel will be making requests to.

**Note:** Vite requires environment variables exposed to the browser to be prefixed with `VITE_`.

```env
# The base URL for your backend API
VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
